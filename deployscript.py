# The deployment flow script should perform the following steps:
# Download image resources file from AWS S3 (https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/devops-exercise/pandapics.tar.gz) and extract it's content to '/public/images' path.
# Create, build & run the App + DB using “docker-compose up” command.
# Check the App's health (See App's healthcheck below) at the end of the deployment flow and fail the deployment flow upon bad App health.
